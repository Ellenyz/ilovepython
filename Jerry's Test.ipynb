    "\n",
    "**Problems to ask:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* What's the impact of this strategy: How many (new vs. recurring) users have participanted in the reward program, got the 10 dollar discount; how many of these users have redeemed the 10 dollar discount?\n",
    "* Have the number of new customers increased after the reward program begins? How many new users get the 20 dollar discount? (actual impact of this promo event)\n",
    "* Does revenue (sum of total pays) increase after implementing this strategy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consumers can only use either 10 or 20 dollar at one time.(Only users purchased at least once can get access to the 10 dollar discount)\n",
    "* Users who have purchased and redeemed 20 dollar can not get 20 dollar discount again\n",
    "* Assume the campaign started from March 1st\n",
    "* No obvious business cycle (market for Jan-May is similar to market for Mar-May), if not, comaring with the corresponding period of last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Questions to ask internal stakeholders**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can users redeem these two discounts in the same order?\n"

    "1. If *the total number of users that redeemed \\$10* takes a vast majority (say 90\\%+) of the existing users who order during the reward program period, then the participation of this campain can be gauranteed.\n",
    "2. The proportion of *total number of users that redeemed \\$20* divided by *total number of users that redeemed \\$10* can evaluate the exact impact of referral message (e.g. conversion rate). A higher rate indicates larger impact, and will make analyst more willing to make a recommendation.\n",
    "3. Since one unique user can order more than once and be qualified for \\$10 discount more than once. The proportion of *total number of orders with a redemption of \\$20* divided by *total number of orders with a redemption of \\$10* can be treated as a validation and addition to the previous point.\n",
    "4. Comparing data of the 2 month after the reward program begins with the data of 2 month prior to the campaign, if the total revenue increases significantly, we may conclude that this campain is effective in driving higher revenue; if the total number of orders increases significantly, we may conclude that this program works well in driving new orders. \n",
    "5. All above metrics should be considered combiningly while determining whether to make a recommendation or not.\n",
    "6. All above steps should be taken again when we change control group from 01/01/2021-03/01/2021 to 03/01/2020-05/01/2020 as a validation.\n",
